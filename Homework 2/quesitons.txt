The detection is pretty accurate, but it fails a little more in the redblue.mov
example. This is due to the detected circles being relatively close to each other. 
Other sources of detected error are mostly from motion distorting the circles
or the reflections on the balls.

The measurement seems relatively accurate. It's stating that the ball is somewhere
in the foot and a half range, which seems relatively accurate for someone holding an
iPhone taking a video of a ball in their other hand.
