Homework 2 Answers - James McRoberts

Part 1: [5]
The detection is pretty accurate, but it fails a little more in the redblue.mov
example. This is due to the detected circles being relatively close to each other. 
Other sources of detected error are mostly from motion distorting the circles
or the reflections on the balls.

Part 2: [5]
The measurement seems relatively accurate. It's stating that the ball is somewhere
in the foot and a half range, which seems relatively accurate for someone holding an
iPhone taking a video of a ball in their other hand.

Part 3: [4]
The box appears correct as the perspective of the lines seems to accurately distort
as the balls move away from the centerpoint of the camera. Along with that, it's
correctly bounded, used the functions from the in class videos, and seems to also
properly distort the cube as it moves away from the camera (on the z axis).

Part 3: [5]
It is possible. The angle from the other bounding box could be incorporated into
a transformation matrix with a rotation property. It might need to be done for the
XZ and YZ planes individually, but it can be simplified down to some sort of
homographic projection.
